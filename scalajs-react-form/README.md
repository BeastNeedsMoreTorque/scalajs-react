Simple form library much like with significant abstractions to make form
rendering flexible.

Very few assumptions are made around how forms are actually composed as there
are many different ways to code up a form.

A few concerns that are abstracted out include:

* How the data object a form represents is represented.
* Validation of data.
* Form state.
* Form submission. 

# Example


# Buliding Blocks
This form library abstracts out form handling to ensure that it can be adapted
to most form situations.
