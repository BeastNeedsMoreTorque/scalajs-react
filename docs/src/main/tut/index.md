# scalajs-react

A facade over reactjs that provides a more functional API in the spirit of ReasonReact.

# Getting Started



# ReasonReact
The scalajs-react interface is built on the model provided by ![ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/intro-example.html). You can apply the same concept to this API.

# API Documentation

* [all modules](api/ttg)


The redux project is limited to allowing you to connect your component to an existing redux store but it does not try to provide access to the full redux API. It is essentially the scala.js side version for scalajs-react much like the project `react-redux`.
