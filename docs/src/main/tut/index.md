# scalajs-react

A facade over reactjs that provides a more functional API in the spirit of ReasonReact.

# Getting Started



# ReasonReact
The scalajs-react interface is built on the model provided by [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/intro-example.html). You can apply the same concept to this API.
