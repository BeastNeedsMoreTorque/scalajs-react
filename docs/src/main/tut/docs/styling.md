Styling is a topic with many wide-ranging solutions. I suggest you check out the [blog](http://appddeevvmeanderings.blogspot.com/2017/08/web-app-styling-interlude-how-to.html) on how to think about the styling approach that will work for you.

Generally, doing styling in the language, e.g. js or scala, allows you to customize the styling while still retaining most levels of performance. Heavy and complex styling will always require a complex process.
