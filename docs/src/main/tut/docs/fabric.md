[Fabric](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) is a Microsoft react UI library with many components and is freely available to make office looking interfaces. It also has many infrastructure functions to handle themes and styling. A simple facade has been included in `scalajs-react-fabric` that is a WIP since the API is quite large and complex. Fabric is written in typescript. `scalajs-react`s demo application was written with fabric.
